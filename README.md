# Video Game Combat Simulator
Starting the summer after my junior year, I began to practice the programming techniques I learned by simulating the logic-based combat system of a somewhat complex video game I used to play. And in-depth overview of the code's functionality is detailed below.

To generalize, combat in this game is intriguing in that one action can set off a unique chain of other actions based on probability (i.e. missing an attack could trigger an opponent's ability, which, in turn, triggers one of the player's, and successful completion of that attack could trigger a subsequent one, etc.). Since the outcomes become extraordinarily complex with so many variables (which can be customized or automatically calculated using a regression algorithm), the simulator can tell the user what the statistically "best" course of action is when it may appear unclear. In this sense, it functions as an AI of sorts, simulating outcomes and making a decision based on the data it collects.
